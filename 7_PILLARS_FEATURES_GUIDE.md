# 7 Pillars Feature - Complete Functional & Features Guide

## Overview

The 7 Pillars is a governance and community contribution framework that transforms the platform from a simple discussion forum into a structured knowledge-building system. It organizes all discussions around 6 foundational pillars, where community members collectively answer fundamental questions about how the platform should function.

**Core Concept**: Each pillar represents a core value, and within each pillar are 7 "seed questions" that the community collectively works to resolve through discussion and consensus.

## Content Moderation & Resolution Logic

### How Questions Get "Resolved"
A seed question is marked as resolved when:
1. **Discussion has stabilized**: Post volume has dropped (consensus reached or debate exhausted)
2. **Community consensus indicator**: Admin or moderation team reviews discussion and identifies emerging consensus
3. **Timeline**: After a certain period of activity (e.g., 30+ days of discussion)
4. **Manual marking**: Moderators can mark as resolved if clear consensus exists

### Reopening Questions
- If new evidence or perspectives emerge, a resolved question can be reopened
- Community can vote to reopen
- Keeps the system dynamic and responsive to new information

## Key Takeaway

The 7 Pillars transforms your platform from a simple discussion forum into a **structured governance and values system**. Community members don't just chat—they collectively answer fundamental questions about how the platform should operate. This creates:

- **Purpose**: Users contribute to something larger than themselves
- **Organization**: Discussions naturally categorized by values
- **Progress**: Clear visible movement toward complete governance framework
- **Community**: Shared purpose creates stronger bonds
- **Quality**: Constructive framing reduces toxicity

Your next version can adapt these concepts to your architecture while maintaining the core philosophy: **Let the community collectively build the platform's values and governance through structured, progressive discussions.**
