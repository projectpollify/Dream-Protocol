## 📈 Recent Accomplishments

### October 31, 2025
- ✅ **Module 08: Social - COMPLETE** 🎉
  - **Database Migration**: Successfully deployed 7 social tables with partial unique indexes

    - `follows` (dual-identity follow relationships)
    - `notifications` (in_app, email, push delivery channels)
    - `notification_preferences` (granular user control)
    - `social_stats` (denormalized follower/following counts)
    - `activity_feed` (personalized feed for followed users)
    - `blocks` (user blocking with automatic follow removal)
  - **Partial Index Fix**: Applied recommended solution for NULL-safe unique constraints
    - `idx_reactions_unique_post` WHERE post_id IS NOT NULL
    - `idx_reactions_unique_comment` WHERE comment_id IS NOT NULL
    - Prevents duplicate reactions while handling optional foreign keys correctly
  - **Service Implementation**: 5 comprehensive services with business logic
    - **Reaction Service**: Add/remove reactions, get counts, check user reactions
    - **Follow Service**: Follow/unfollow, get followers/following, check relationships, update stats
    - **Notification Service**: Create notifications, mark read, manage preferences, get unread count
    - **Feed Service**: Personalized feed from follows, trending content, user activities, log events
    - **Block Service**: Block/unblock users, check status, auto-remove follows bidirectionally
  - **API Routes**: 18+ RESTful endpoints for complete social functionality
    - Reactions: POST, DELETE, GET (by post/comment/user)
    - Follows: POST, DELETE, GET (followers/following/counts/check)
